This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on an infinite list, which will result in the program never terminating.  It tries to find the first even number in an infinite list of odd numbers. 
```haskell
import Data.List (find)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5..] 
  let evenNumber = find (
 x -> even x) oddNumbers
  print evenNumber
```
