The solution involves using a finite portion of the infinite list or using a different approach that handles the potential absence of the element.  Here's a revised version using `take` to limit the search space.
```haskell
import Data.List (find)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5..]
  let limitedList = take 1000 oddNumbers  -- Limit search to the first 1000 elements
  let evenNumber = find (\x -> even x) limitedList
  print evenNumber -- Will print 'Nothing' since no even number is found.
```
Alternatively, you could use a function that returns a `Maybe` type to handle the possibility of not finding the element.
```haskell
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let oddNumbers = [1,3,5..] 
  let evenNumber = find (
 x -> even x) oddNumbers
  let result = fromMaybe (-1) evenNumber -- Default to -1 if not found
  print result
```
